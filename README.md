Implementation of Particle systems in Unity and custom textures in After Effects.

## Notes 

Particles = a way of creating many instances of a piece of data(usually geometry or/and textures) which moves together in specific ways.e.g.a ring can become a shock wave, a basic line can become a cloud of sparks. Most particle systems are just squares with images on them to create illusions of volumetric effect.

There is a balance on the textures on the particles and their movement behaviour. The best effects are achieved with a combination of the right texture and appropriate particle behaviour.
